Huffman Decompresssion

As one of final homework assignments in my ICS 211 course, we had to write a Huffman Decompression program.  The program was to take in a file that had been compressed using Huffman enocding, and return a file that contained the original contents before compression.

The program was written and Java and has been tested to work with *.txt, *.mp3, *.bmp files.  It runs from the command line.

A sample of the decoding walkthrough can be found on the original homework assignment page located <a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ztomasze/teaching/ics211/2012fa/hw/A11.html">here</a>, under the discussion section.
