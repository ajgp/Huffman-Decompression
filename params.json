{"name":"Huffman-decompression","tagline":"Decompresses a Huffman encoded file","body":"Huffman-Decompression\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nAs one of final homework assignments in my ICS 211 course, we had to write a Huffman Decompression program.  The program was to take in a file that had been compressed using Huffman enocding, and return a file that contained the original contents before compression.\r\n\r\nThe program was written and Java and has been tested to work with *.txt, *.mp3, *.bmp files.  It runs from the command line.\r\n\r\nA sample of the decoding walkthrough can be found on the original homework assignment page located <a href=\"http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ztomasze/teaching/ics211/2012fa/hw/A11.html\">here</a>, under the discussion section.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Run\r\n====================\r\nFirst be sure you have the most recent <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html\">Java JDK</a> installed on your system.\r\n\r\nSet  up your <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html\">PATH variable</a>.\r\n\r\nNext, compile all three source files using the javac command.  <a href=\"http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-the-javac-command.html\">How to use javac</a>\r\n\r\nLastly to run the program use the command:\r\n<code>java DecompressTest [file name]</code>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
