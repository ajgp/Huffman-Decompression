Huffman-Decompression
=====================

As one of final homework assignments in my ICS 211 course, we had to write a Huffman Decompression program.  The program was to take in a file that had been compressed using Huffman enocding, and return a file that contained the original contents before compression.

The program was written and Java and has been tested to work with *.txt, *.mp3, *.bmp files.  It runs from the command line.

A sample of the decoding walkthrough can be found on the original homework assignment page located <a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ztomasze/teaching/ics211/2012fa/hw/A11.html">here</a>, under the discussion section.


How to Run
====================
First be sure you have the most recent <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">Java JDK</a> installed on your system.

Set  up your <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html">PATH variable</a>.

Next, compile all three source files using the javac command.  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-the-javac-command.html">How to use javac</a>

Lastly to run the program use the command:
<code>java DecompressTest [file name]</code>
